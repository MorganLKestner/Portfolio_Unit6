    <h2>Hi, I'm Morgan!</h2>
    <p >I've recently graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive track and I'm looking for new opportunities to develop and create solutions that are fun for people to use. I'm creative, professional, and easy to work with. I have years of experience working in the high stakes and upbeat fashion and entertainment industry and I'm looking forward to translating my professional and intellectual skills in my new career direction.
</p><p>
I code in Ruby on Rails and I've picked up other languages and front-end experience along the way. I'm passionate about learning and using new technologies.
I love tackling challenges and developing efficient solutions that are fun for people to use.</p>
